  <p>"No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life," says the president. "Look at these <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu" target="_blank">words</a>. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small."</p>

  <p>I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website.</p>

  <p>My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.
  Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.</p>

    An "unordered list"
    <ul>

  <p>An "ordered" list
    <ol>
      <li>Thing 1</li>
      <li>Thing 2</li>
