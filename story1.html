    <h1>Will Private Development on NYCHA Land Ease Wyckoff Residents&#39; Burdens?</h1>

    <h2>A NexGen development is planned at Wyckoff Gardens, but it may not be a welcome solution to some desperately needed repairs.</h2>

    <p>Residents at Wyckoff Gardens are unsure a private development on New York City Housing Authority land will benefit them, even as they face needed repairs.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care about us. The only thing they want is the money,&rdquo; said Maria Mu&ntilde;iz, 70, who has lived in Wyckoff Gardens for 13 years. She has dealt with mold in her bathroom, a malfunctioning stove that has not been replaced, pests, a leaky kitchen faucet and a broken radiator that she says releases fumes.</p>

    <p>NYCHA&rsquo;s NextGen Neighborhoods program will see two 16-story mixed-income buildings developed by The Arker Companies and Two Trees at Wyckoff Gardens through a 99-year ground lease. The development is projected to bring $37 million, half of which will go toward covering Wyckoff&rsquo;s $43 million in needed repairs, according to NYCHA. But to some living in the complex, the returns might not outweigh the costs.</p>

    <blockquote>&ldquo;The rich do not want to live next to the poor. They&rsquo;re going to try to live in a community that the people who live right next door will have no access.&rdquo;</blockquote>

    <p>Marlina Sanchez, 36, has lived in Wyckoff since 1988. At times, she said, it&rsquo;s difficult to get repairs when she needs them, which puts a burden on her schedule. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t even show up because they&rsquo;re short staffed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So you had to take a day off of work so they could come fix something in your house and they don&rsquo;t even show up at all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mu&ntilde;iz said requests for repairs have been heard, but the issues sometimes go unaddressed. When she reported her leaking faucet, maintenance arrived to address the ticket, but did nothing. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t fix it because he said that was a job for two and he was only one,&rdquo; Mu&ntilde;iz said. She said she later found the ticket was closed, though no repair was made.</p>

    <p>Resident association president, Valerie Bell, refused to comment on needed repairs and the NextGen development.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, I&rsquo;ve been dealing with them for a long time, and that&rsquo;s not going to help,&rdquo; said Mu&ntilde;iz about the NextGen development. &ldquo;All they&rsquo;re going to do is isolate the people that they&rsquo;re going to put in there, and we&rsquo;re gonna be in the same here.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The rich do not want to live next to the poor,&rdquo; said Alicia Boyd, founder of the Brooklyn Anti-Gentrification Network. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to try to live in a community that the people who live right next door will have no access.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Romuda Hill, a 23-year resident of Wyckoff Gardens has the same suspicion. &ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s not going to affect us &mdash; it&rsquo;s gonna affect us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Lets be honest. Would you spend $3,000-$4,000 in rent and have this building here?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>NYCHA did not return a request for comment, but a press release announcing the new development said &ldquo;NYCHA is committed to minimizing any impacts to residents.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Andrea Ortiz, 72, became a resident of Wyckoff in the 70s. She said the development is needed because people can&rsquo;t live on the streets and the money will benefit Wyckoff. &ldquo;A lot of people want things to come free, but that doesn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; said Ortiz. &ldquo;The government has expenses.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Ortiz said she was largely apathetic.</p>
