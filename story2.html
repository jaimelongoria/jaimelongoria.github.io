  <p>The number of water main breaks in Brooklyn is on the rise, which suggests the city's water delivery system may need some work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Typically water main breaks are related to pressure, so the higher the pressure the higher you have water main breaks,&rdquo; said James N. Jensen, professor of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering at the University at Buffalo.</p>
  <p>In Brooklyn, the number of complaints for water main breaks has increased by nearly 50 percent since 2013, according to an analysis of city data.</p>


  
  <p>Some water utilities may have problems maintaining an adequate amount of pressure throughout the system. This can lead to more breaks at points called high service pumps, which are areas along the water delivery system typically see higher levels of pressure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There may be some issues trying to balance the pressure in the system,&rdquo; said Jensen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What may happen too is if you get the build of scale, minerals within the pipe, the diameter of the pipe will get smaller,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you have pressure in a pipe that you think is 12 inches in diameter rather than 10 inches in diameter because of that build up, you&rsquo;re more likely to get a break there, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even though water main breaks can occur with more frequency in older water delivery systems, there is really nothing abnormal about a break.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Breaks will happen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a normal part of operation.&rdquo;</p>
